# Cursor Rules
- Use Bun for scripts (`bun install`, `bun run dev`).
- Format and lint code with Biome (`bun run format`, `bun run lint`).
- Place shadcn/ui components under `components/ui` and style with Tailwind CSS.
- Prefer TypeScript and functional React components with hooks.
- Use `@tanstack/react-query` for async state and `zustand` for client-side stores.
- Write unit tests with Jest (jsdom) and E2E tests with Playwright.
- Follow Conventional Commits and run tests before pushing.
